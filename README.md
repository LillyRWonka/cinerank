## Description
Cinerank is a new movie information and review application that allows for users to search for a recently watched movie and displays information about the movie, the movie poster and other pertinent information.

The response of the user can be submitted and stored via locally on the computer.  

## Usage
To search for a movie, locate the textbox under the main title of the page to type the name of the movie you would like to view. The user can also provide the year that the movie was released for a more accurate search.
